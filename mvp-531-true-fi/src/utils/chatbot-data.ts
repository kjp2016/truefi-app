              salary growth in your consulting role, age, credit history, and some practical contingencies,
              here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd suggest for an ideal home purchase scenario:</br></br>
              <ul class="ul-list">
                <li><strong>Purchase Price:</strong> $500,000 ‚Äì This price range aligns with your monthly income and
              budget flexibility, keeping your finances healthy while allowing you to focus on other
              goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Down Payment:</strong> 20% ($100,000) ‚Äì A 20% down payment helps you avoid private
              mortgage insurance (PMI), reducing monthly costs and securing a more favorable
              loan structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> 7.445% ‚Äì Reflects the current market average, though I‚Äôll keep an eye
              out for opportunities to refinance if rates drop.</li>
                <li><strong>Loan Term:</strong> 30 years ‚Äì A 30-year term balances monthly affordability with
              manageable long-term debt, leaving more cash for your lifestyle and investments.</li>
                <li><strong>Property Taxes:</strong> Estimated around $3,750 per year ‚Äì Calculated based on local
              property tax rates, this estimate keeps you prepared for any tax adjustments.</li>
                <li><strong>Home Insurance:</strong> Approximately $2,500 per year ‚Äì A standard insurance estimate
              for this property type and area, ensuring adequate coverage without overextending
              your budget.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintenance Costs:</strong> About 1% of the home value, or $5,000 per year ‚Äì It‚Äôs wise to
              set aside around 1% annually for repairs and maintenance, helping you avoid
              surprise expenses.</li>
                <li><strong>Closing Costs:</strong> 4% ($20,000) ‚Äì Typical closing costs that cover legal, appraisal, and
              administrative fees, giving you a realistic view of upfront costs.</li>
              </ul></br>
              Your <strong>total monthly housing cost</strong> for a $500,000 property would be around <strong>$3,719</strong>. This
              setup keeps you within budget while building equity, without over-stretching on upfront
              costs or monthly payments. How does that sound?"`,

                  improve your long-term wealth. But if you‚Äôre thinking of moving sooner, renting may

              Here‚Äôs how we can adjust your budget to make it work comfortably:</br></br>
              <ol class="number-list">
                <li><strong>Car Budget Adjustment:</strong> You‚Äôre on track to purchase the $30,000 car you want in 24
                  months. Our original plan was to make a 5% down payment with a 48-month term.
                  However, with your upcoming home purchase, you might consider adjusting to a $22,800
                  certified pre-owned model. By putting 5% down and extending the term to 60 months, you
                  can stay within budget without impacting your retirement timeline. This approach keeps
                  your finances intact while accommodating both goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Gym Membership:</strong> Consider switching from Equinox to LA Fitness.</li>
                <li><strong>Dining Out Less:</strong> Reducing dining out from 3x a week to 1x could save around $300 monthly</li>
              </ol></br>
              These adjustments would cover the extra housing cost without affecting your long-term
              goals, like retirement or your down payment for a future investment property`,
